## Fakenote.js

**Fakenote.js** is a library forked from [react-canvas-draw](https://github.com/embiem/react-canvas-draw), with the goal being to modify the original library in order to make the canvas and generated result similar to Nintendo's Flipnote Hatena.

### Who made this?

Flipnote.js is made by [@lunaisnotaboy](https://github.com/lunaisnotaboy).

### Why?

I did this because I needed a canvas that was easy-to-use and had a similar look and feel to Flipnote Studio's canvas.

### WHere can I find this?

Right now, this is located on [GitHub](https://github.com/lunaisnotaboy/fakenote), but ~~hopefully~~ it will be on NPM soon.
